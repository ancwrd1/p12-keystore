## Overview

This project contains a simple to use high-level library to work with PKCS#12/PFX keystores, written in pure Rust,
modeled after Java KeyStore API.

Features:

* Single- and multi-keychain PKCS#12
* Support for 'truststores' with only CA root certificates
* Modern and legacy encryption schemes
* Able to read and write Java-compatible keystores
* Support for secret keys and generation of secret keys compatible to Java

Limitations:

* MD5-based encryption schemes are not supported
* Single password is used to encrypt both private keys and certificate data in one store
* Non-encrypted stores are not supported
